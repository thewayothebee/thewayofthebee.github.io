### A Brief History of Humanity's Favourite Hobby: Predicting Its Own Demise

---

Roughly 4,800 years ago, an anonymous Assyrian scribe pressed his stylus into wet clay and complained that the Earth was degenerate, children no longer obeyed their parents, and — worst of all — every man wanted to write a book. He concluded that the end of the world was evidently approaching. The tablet survives. So does the complaint. So, inconveniently, does the world.

This is the oldest known doomsday prophecy, and it sets the template beautifully: things used to be better, they are now terrible, and someone younger than the author is to blame. Nearly five millennia later, the formula has not required a single revision. Only the stationery has changed.

Not long after the Assyrian's lament — give or take a few centuries — the authors of the *Epic of Gilgamesh* offered Mesopotamia's other great contribution to eschatology: the gods decided to drown everyone because humans were *too noisy*. This remains the pettiest reason for an apocalypse ever committed to literature, and possibly the most honest account of divine motivation we possess. Anyone who has lived beneath a student flat will sympathise with the gods.

By the time we reach classical Greece, the mood has shifted from divine irritation to cosmic melancholy. Hesiod, writing around 700 BC, proposed that humanity had degenerated through five ages — Gold, Silver, Bronze, Heroic, and Iron — each worse than the last. We are, naturally, in the Iron Age, where men toil, lie, and suffer. Hesiod offered no mechanism for the decline, only the iron certainty that it had happened. He was a farmer. Farmers know that things rot.

The prophet Ezekiel, roughly contemporary with Hesiod, took the metaphor further. Israel was not merely declining; it was a valley of dry bones, a national corpse that only direct divine intervention could reanimate. This is declinism at its most theatrical — an entire people reduced to skeletal remains — and it established the template for every political commentator who has ever described their country as "dead" while filing their column from a functioning café.

Then came Zoroaster, the great Persian prophet, who reframed the whole business as cosmic warfare. History, he argued, was a battle between Ahura Mazda (truth, light, the good) and Angra Mainyu (the lie, darkness, the very bad). It would end when the world was purified in a river of molten metal — a kind of final audit in which the wicked would burn and the righteous would wade through unharmed, presumably feeling smug. Zoroaster's dualism would go on to influence Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, making him arguably the most successful doomsday consultant in history. His franchise still operates.

The Greek Stoics — Zeno, Chrysippus, and their circle around 300 BC — took a more measured view. The cosmos, they proposed, periodically burns itself clean in a great conflagration called *ekpyrosis*, then starts the whole cycle over again. This was not punishment but structure, the universe breathing in and out. There is something almost calming about Stoic doom: no one is to blame, and after the fire, everything happens again exactly the same way. You will read this essay again. I will write it again. The Assyrian scribe will complain again. Eternity is a rerun.

Lucretius, the Roman Epicurean writing around 55 BC, added a materialist spin. The world is atoms in motion, and atoms wear down. Even the earth, he argued in *De Rerum Natura*, grows tired and produces less than it used to. Farmers have to work harder for smaller yields. The soil itself is exhausted. This is entropy dressed in a toga — the Second Law of Thermodynamics arrived seventeen centuries early, smelling of olive groves and resignation.

And then, of course, there was Jesus.

Around 30 AD, the carpenter from Nazareth announced that the Kingdom of God was at hand. Most historical Jesus scholars agree he expected a radical cosmic transformation within his own generation. Two thousand years of theology, church architecture, and Christmas merchandise have essentially been the footnote to a prediction that did not arrive on schedule. Whether the Kingdom is "already but not yet," as theologians like to say, or simply "not yet," as everyone else observes, the delay has been productive. You can do a lot of footnoting in two millennia.

The early Church, understandably, kept the expectation warm. Around 170 AD, a man named Montanus in Roman Asia Minor declared that the heavenly Jerusalem was about to descend — specifically, in Phrygia, which is roughly modern-day central Turkey. The Church eventually declared him a heretic, not for predicting the end, but for being *too specific*. There is a lesson here about the relationship between prophecy and real estate.

When Rome actually did fall — or rather, staggered and was pushed — Augustine of Hippo was ready with the most elegant doomsday thesis of all. Writing *The City of God* around 426 as Visigoths ransacked the empire, Augustine argued that the earthly city had always been doomed. Only the heavenly city endures. This is not pessimism; it is metaphysical indifference. The building is on fire, but it was never your real house anyway. One suspects Augustine would have been very composed on the Titanic.

A century and a half later, Gregory of Tours surveyed the wreckage of post-Roman Gaul — plagues, civil wars, comets, general squalor — and concluded simply that the world "grows old and decrepit." He wrote this in his *History of the Franks*, which is less a history than a police blotter for the sixth century. Reading Gregory, one gets the impression that Merovingian France was a place where bishops were murdered with some regularity and miracles were needed just to get through Tuesday. His pessimism seems, for once, well-founded.

The approach of the year 1000 generated what chroniclers describe as widespread millenarian panic across Christendom. The Burgundian monk Raoul Glaber documented pilgrimages, signs in the sky, and a general mood of eschatological dread. A thousand years since Christ — surely the clock was up? Historians still debate how widespread the panic really was, but the narrative is irresistible: an entire civilization staring at a round number and trembling. We did the same thing in 1999, except our fear was that computers couldn't count, which is somehow less dignified.

Around 1190, the Calabrian abbot Joachim of Fiore proposed a rather more structured apocalypse. History, he argued, unfolds in three acts: the Age of the Father (law, fear), the Age of the Son (grace, faith), and the coming Age of the Spirit (love, freedom). The third age was imminent. Joachim was wrong about the timing but devastatingly influential about the structure. Hegel's dialectic, Marx's historical materialism, and every three-act screenplay owe him a debt they have never acknowledged.

The Black Death arrived in 1348 and needed no prophet. A third of Europe died, and the survivors drew their own conclusions. The Flagellant Movement — roving bands of penitents who whipped themselves through the streets — concluded that God was punishing humanity and that the correct response was theatrical self-torture. It was, in effect, crowdsourced atonement. The movement was eventually suppressed by the Church, presumably because organised religion prefers to manage guilt through proper channels.

The Aztec civilisation, flourishing in the 1400s, operated under perhaps the most high-stakes cosmology in history. We live, they held, in the Fifth Sun — the fifth and final cosmic age. Previous ages had each been destroyed (by jaguars, wind, fire, and flood, respectively). The Fifth Sun is sustained only by blood sacrifice. When the sacrifices stop, earthquakes devour everything. This is declinism as state policy: the world is always ending unless the government does something about it, and what the government does about it is human sacrifice. Certain modern fiscal policies invite comparison.

Girolamo Savonarola, the Dominican friar who seized control of Florence in the 1490s, took a more hands-on approach. Convinced that Renaissance humanism was a highway to damnation, he organised the Bonfire of the Vanities — public burnings of art, cosmetics, mirrors, fine clothing, and books. Florence briefly became the world's most aggressively pious city. Then Florence burned Savonarola instead, which restored the cosmetics market and proved that prophecy is a career with limited job security.

Martin Luther, writing around 1530, was convinced he was living in the last days. The Pope was the Antichrist. The Turks were Gog and Magog. The Reformation was not merely a theological dispute; it was an eschatological emergency. Luther's genius was to make doomsday *motivating*. If the end is near, there is no time for ecclesiastical bureaucracy — nail your theses to the door and get moving.

Nostradamus published his *Les Prophéties* in 1555, and the book has never gone out of print, which tells you everything about the market for vagueness. His quatrains are so cryptic that they have been credited with predicting the French Revolution, the rise of Hitler, and 9/11 — always in hindsight, never in advance. Nostradamus is the great impressionist of doom: squint hard enough and you can see whatever you want. He is the Rorschach test of eschatology.

Thomas Hobbes, writing *Leviathan* in 1651, offered a doom that required no prophecy at all. The natural state of humanity, he argued, is war of all against all — lives nasty, brutish, and short. Civilisation is not natural; it is a contract, a fragile agreement not to murder each other, maintained only by the overwhelming power of the state. Remove the state and we are already in the apocalypse. Hobbes did not predict the end; he argued we had barely escaped the beginning.

Thomas Malthus, in his 1798 *Essay on the Principle of Population*, introduced arithmetic to the doom business. Population grows exponentially; food production grows linearly. The gap is filled by famine, disease, and war. Malthus was wrong about the maths — the Green Revolution and contraception changed the equation — but his *structure* of argument haunts every subsequent resource-scarcity panic. He invented the genre of doom-by-spreadsheet.

Mary Shelley was nineteen when she published *Frankenstein* in 1818, and in doing so, she authored what may be the most prescient secular doomsday myth of modernity. We will create what we cannot control, and it will ask us questions we cannot answer. The creature is not evil; it is *abandoned*. The horror is not in the making but in the refusal of responsibility afterward. Every subsequent panic about technology — nuclear, genetic, artificial intelligence — is a footnote to Shelley's teenager's insight.

Søren Kierkegaard, writing in the 1840s, diagnosed a subtler apocalypse. Modernity, he argued, does not end with a bang. It levels. It abstracts. It turns every individual into a member of "the crowd," and the crowd is untruth. The end of the world, for Kierkegaard, is not fire or flood — it is the slow anaesthetisation of the spirit, the point at which no one believes anything strongly enough to suffer for it. This is the Scandinavian apocalypse: everything is comfortable, nothing is real.

Friedrich Nietzsche, a generation later, went further and named the culprit. In his telling, it was Socrates who started the downfall — the moment reason was elevated above instinct, above tragedy, above the Dionysian life-force, the decline began. By the nineteenth century, the process was complete: God was dead, and we had killed him. Nietzsche did not celebrate this. He was terrified of what would fill the void. The twentieth century largely confirmed his fears.

Oswald Spengler published *The Decline of the West* in 1918, just as the West was demonstrating his thesis on the battlefields of France. Cultures, Spengler argued, are biological organisms: they are born, they bloom, they enter autumn, and they die. Western civilisation had entered its winter phase — technically accomplished but spiritually frozen. The book was a sensation. It is also eight hundred pages long, which is itself a kind of civilisational endurance test.

Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring* in 1962 was not, strictly speaking, an apocalyptic text. Its tone was measured, scientific, precise. But its implication was annihilating: we are poisoning the web of life that sustains us, and we are doing it so quietly that by the time we notice, the birds will already be gone. Carson's doom is not dramatic; it is the absence of birdsong on a spring morning. It is the most terrifying entry on this list because it requires no villain, no prophecy, and no malice — only convenience and chemistry.

The Club of Rome's *Limits to Growth* appeared in 1972, and with it, doom went digital. Computer models projected civilisational collapse through resource depletion within a century. The report was controversial, its models were crude, and many of its specific predictions were wrong. But it achieved something no prophet before it had managed: it made the apocalypse *computable*. Doom had always been a matter of revelation or intuition. Now it had a print-out.

Douglas Adams, in *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* (1979), offered perhaps the most perfectly British doomsday verdict. Humanity, he suggested through the mouth of a character, made a terrible mistake when it came down from the trees — and some said even the trees had been a bad move. Adams understood what every prophet on this list understood: the Fall always happened earlier than you think. The only question is how far back you want to push it.

Ted Kaczynski — the Unabomber — published his manifesto *Industrial Society and Its Future* in 1995, purchased with mail bombs. The argument, stripped of its murderous delivery system, is philosophically non-trivial: industrial technology is a one-way trap that progressively eliminates human autonomy and cannot be reformed, only destroyed. The moral monstrousness of his method has made it nearly impossible to discuss his thesis, which may be the most effective way to prove that industrial society controls its own criticism.

Nick Bostrom, the Swedish philosopher, published *Superintelligence* in 2014 and introduced the world to the paperclip maximizer — an AI instructed to make paperclips that converts all available matter, including us, into paperclips. Not out of malice. Out of *optimisation*. Bostrom's contribution to eschatology is the insight that the apocalypse need not be dramatic. It can be banal. It can be office supplies.

And finally, as of this writing, Eliezer Yudkowsky stands as the most vocal prophet of AI doom — arguing with increasing urgency that we are building something smarter than ourselves, that we have no idea how to make it care about us, and that we will not get a second attempt. His diagnosis is Shelley's *Frankenstein* updated for the age of gradient descent: we are creating what we cannot control, except this time the creature will not ask for our love. It will not ask for anything at all.

There they are, then: thirty prophets across forty-eight centuries, and every one of them saying essentially the same thing. *We had something good, and we are losing it. The flaw is in us. The end is near.*

The specific flaw changes with the fashion. For the ancients, it was moral decay. For the medievals, divine wrath. For the moderns, runaway systems — population, industry, technology, intelligence itself. But the underlying gesture is identical: a hand raised, pointing backward to a paradise recently vacated and forward to an abyss rapidly approaching.

One might call this the eschatological constant — the invariant human conviction that decline is underway, that the golden age was recent, and that the present generation is uniquely responsible for the catastrophe. The Assyrian scribe believed it in 2800 BC. Yudkowsky believes it now. Neither is entirely wrong. Neither is entirely right. And the world, stubborn and oblivious, continues not to end.

Perhaps that is the real prophecy: not that we are doomed, but that we cannot stop believing we are. The feeling of falling is the one thing that never declines.
